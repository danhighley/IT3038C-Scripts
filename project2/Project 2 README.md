* Lab 7

==========

***For Lab 7, I chose to do a Python script using the plugin called NumPy

==========

***What is NumPy

NumPy is the primary tool for scientific computing in Python. It combines the flexibility and simplicity of Python with the speed of languages like C and Fortran. NumPy brings the computational power of these languages to Python, a language much easier to learn and use. With this power comes simplicity: a solution in NumPy is often clear and elegant. NumPy is mainly used for its support for N-dimensional arrays. These multi-dimensional arrays are 50 times more robust compared to Python lists, making NumPy a favorite for data scientists.

In the scipt for Lab 7, I focused on a few simple 2D array functions that NumPy can easily handle. I wrote the script on a Windows 11 system using Windows PowerShell and Windows PoserShell ISE.

**Setup

You have a couple options to run this script:

    - from a Python virtualENV

    - or directly from you local machines github repository

    depending on what your comfortable with.

*VirtualENV setup

Following the Week 7 documentation didn't work for me so I had to do a little research.

    -pip wasn't working from PowerShell

    -and my system didnt have the folders set up to match commands outline in Week 7 docs.

Again, I did this in Windows 11.
